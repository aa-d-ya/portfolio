export const HERO_CONTENT = `I have a strong passion for building modern, interactive, and high-performance web applications. I specialize in React and Next.js, leveraging Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion to create sleek, responsive designs with smooth animations.

On the backend, I work with Node.js and Spring Boot, ensuring efficient application logic and performance. My strong foundation in Java development allows me to solve complex problems using Data Structures and Algorithms, enhancing optimization and efficiency.

With a growing interest in DevOps, I use Docker to streamline deployments and improve scalability.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Hey there! I’m a third-year Computer Science student with a passion for front-end development and creative tech. I love exploring the latest frameworks, crafting sleek user interfaces, and bringing ideas to life with clean, interactive designs. As part of SARK (Tech Club) in my college, I’ve organized multiple tech events, connecting enthusiasts and innovators.

Beyond tech, I’m a visual storyteller. Being part of Adlib Arts (Photography & Videography Club), I dive into video editing, transforming raw clips into cinematic pieces.

When I’m not designing, editing, or geeking out over new tech, you’ll find me chasing sunsets, planning my next trip, or binging horror and thriller movies. And my music? A perfect mix of Taylor Swift’s poetic brilliance and The Weeknd’s dark, moody vibes.`;
